to start you need to drag and drop the "gta downgrade" folder to where your GTA is installed
next open the batch file that matches the version of game and what drive letter your game is installed on
then you have 2 options
1) is to downgrade GTA to version 1.27
2) is to upgrade GTA to the latest version

thats all you really need to know
